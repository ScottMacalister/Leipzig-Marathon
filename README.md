In this project, I explore historic race results from the Leipzig Marathon.

## 📁 Data

I used Selenium to scrape the race results from this website: https://leipzigmarathon.de/ergebnis-suche/

## 🔍 Features

- 📊 Track yearly trends: Total participants, fastest time, and average finish time
- ⏱️ Explore finish time distributions by year with adjustable bin sizes
- 🎨 Colour distributions by age group (`<30`, `30–39`, `40–49`, `50–59`, `>60`)
- 🔎 Search for individual runners by name and see how they performed over time
- 📌 Red X markers show individual results overlaid on the trendline

## Notes

Find more infomation about the Leipzig Marathon here: https://leipzigmarathon.de/chronik/

There was no data available for 1999 and 2022 on the official website.

The races in 2020 and 2021 were held as 'virtuelle Läufe' (virtual runs) due to COVID-19.
